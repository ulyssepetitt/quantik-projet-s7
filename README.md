## 👥 Instructions for Team Members

### 1️⃣ Copy the Template AI
1. Navigate to:
   ```
   ai_players/template/
   ```
2. Copy `algorithme.py` into a **new folder named after you**:
   ```
   ai_players/<your_name>/
   ```
3. Edit the code to implement your own strategy.

---

### 2️⃣ Test Your AI in the Interface
Run the game with:
```bash
python -m gui.app
```
Then select your AI in the dropdown menu and play against it.

---

### 3️⃣ Commit Your Changes
Before pushing, always **pull** the latest version:
```bash
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "Your message here"
git push
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run the Tournament
1. Place all AIs inside `ai_players/` (each in its own folder).
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python -m tournament.run
   ```
3. View the results: win rates, performance stats, and more.

---

## 📌 Tips
- Keep your AI **compatible** with the template interface (`get_move()` method).
- Comment your code in **French** as required for the project.
- Test against different opponents to improve robustness.
